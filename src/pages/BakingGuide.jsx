        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">1. Choose Your Ingredients Wisely</h2>
        <p>
          The quality of your cookies largely depends on the ingredients you use. Always choose fresh, high-quality ingredients. 
          Use unsalted butter for better control over the salt content, fresh eggs, and pure vanilla extract. Fresh baking soda and baking powder also make a big difference.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">2. Measure Ingredients Accurately</h2>
        <p>
          Baking is a precise science, so measuring ingredients accurately is crucial for achieving the best results. Use a digital kitchen scale to weigh ingredients like flour, sugar, and butter. 
          This ensures consistency and prevents common mistakes like over-packing flour or using too much sugar, which can affect the cookie texture.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">3. Chill the Dough</h2>
        <p>
          Chilling the dough before baking allows the flavors to develop and prevents the cookies from spreading too much. 
          Refrigerating the dough for at least 30 minutes can make a significant difference, especially for chocolate chip cookies.

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">4. Use the Right Oven Temperature</h2>
        <p>
          Most cookies are baked at 350°F (175°C), but always double-check your recipe. Baking at too low of a temperature can cause the cookies to spread too much, while too high of a temperature can burn the edges before the center is done.
          Preheating your oven is essential to get an even bake.

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">5. Keep an Eye on the Baking Time</h2>
        <p>
          Each oven is different, so watch your cookies closely, especially during the last few minutes of baking. 
          Most cookies are done when the edges are golden brown, and the center looks just set. 
          They will continue to cook on the baking sheet after you take them out, so don't overbake.
        </p>

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">6. Let the Cookies Cool</h2>
        <p>
          Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack. 
          This helps them firm up without overbaking and ensures a perfect texture every time.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">7. Experiment with Flavors</h2>
        <p>
          Don't be afraid to get creative! Once you master the basics, you can experiment with different add-ins like chocolate chips, nuts, dried fruits, and spices. 
          Try brown butter for a richer flavor or add a dash of cinnamon for warmth.
        </p>

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">8. Store Your Cookies Properly</h2>
        <p>
          To keep your cookies fresh, store them in an airtight container at room temperature. You can also freeze cookie dough for up to 3 months, so you can bake fresh cookies whenever you're in the mood.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">9. Troubleshooting Common Issues</h2>
        <p>
          Cookies too flat? Your butter might have been too warm. Cookies too puffy? You may have used too much flour. 
          Understanding these common problems will help you bake the perfect cookie every time.
